ANALYZING MIGRATIONRUNNER BATCH SPLITTING BUG
==============================================

The MigrationRunner.cs splits SQL by these delimiters:
- "\nGO\n"
- "\nGO\r\n"
- "\r\nGO\r\n"
- "\r\nGO\n"

Let's check the apply_revision_only.sql file format...

Looking at the file, it uses:
- "GO" on its own line

The file might be using different line endings or spacing than what the splitter expects!

HYPOTHESIS:
If the file uses "GO" with different whitespace or line endings than the split patterns,
the entire SQL file might be treated as ONE GIANT BATCH.

When executed as a single batch with nested IF statements and multiple table creations,
SQL Server might fail with an error like:
- "Incorrect syntax near..."
- "Must declare the scalar variable..."
- Or some parsing error

The try-catch in MigrationRunner catches the exception but still prints success!

Let me verify the actual line endings and GO statement format...

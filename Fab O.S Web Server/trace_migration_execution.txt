TRACING MIGRATIONRUNNER EXECUTION
==================================

Given the code logic and our findings, let's trace what actually happened:

1. FACT: User saw "TakeoffRevisionSystem migration applied successfully"
2. FACT: Migration is NOT in __EFMigrationsHistory
3. FACT: TakeoffRevisions table DOES NOT exist
4. FACT: RevisionId column in Packages DOES NOT exist
5. FACT: PackageId in TraceDrawings still EXISTS

ANALYSIS OF CODE FLOW:
-----------------------

Line 58-59: Success message prints
Line 61-66: Catch block returns FALSE
Line 58: Success message is BEFORE return true
Line 54: ExecuteSqlRawAsync is where SQL runs

If exception occurs at line 54:
  → Jumps to catch (line 61)
  → Prints "Error applying migration: {message}"
  → Returns FALSE
  → Success message NEVER prints

If NO exception occurs:
  → All batches execute
  → Line 58 prints success
  → Line 59 returns TRUE

CONCLUSION:
-----------
Since user saw success message, the method must have completed the try block
without throwing an exception. This means:

  A) The SQL batches ran successfully without errors
  B) But the database state shows nothing changed

This is only possible if:
  - The batches executed but all hit "IF NOT EXISTS" guards and skipped
  - BUT we verified migration is NOT in history, so guards should have allowed execution

WAIT... Let me check the PRINT statements!
The SQL script has PRINT statements, but MigrationRunner doesn't capture them.
ExecuteSqlRawAsync only throws exceptions on errors, not for PRINT output.

NEW HYPOTHESIS:
---------------
What if the MigrationRunner was run when the migration WAS in history,
then later the migration entry was manually deleted from __EFMigrationsHistory?

Or what if there's a different database being accessed?

Let me check the connection string used by ApplicationDbContext...
